<h1>Weather Monitoring and Reporting System</h1>
<br>
<br>

<P>This project is an IoT-based weather monitoring and reporting system using an ESP8266 microcontroller. It collects data from various sensors, displays it on an OLED screen, and sends it to the Anedya cloud for real-time monitoring. </P>

<div> <b>Temperature and Humidity Monitoring: </b> Uses the DHT22 sensor to measure temperature and humidity.<br>
 <b>Pressure Monitoring: </b> Uses the BMP180 sensor to measure atmospheric pressure.<br>
 <b>UV Index Monitoring: </b> Uses the GUVA-S12SD sensor to measure UV index.<br>
 <b>Soil Moisture Monitoring: </b> Uses a soil moisture sensor to measure soil humidity.<br>
 <b>OLED Display: </b> Displays the collected data on a 128x64 OLED screen.<br>
 <b>Cloud Integration: </b> Sends the collected data to the Anedya cloud for real-time monitoring and analysis. </div>
